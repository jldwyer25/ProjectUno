Fetchbook

Welcome to Fetchbook! This site allows users to find cats or dogs in their area that are available for adoption. 

To use the site, users choose either cat or dog from the respective drop down, enter your zip code, and hit submit. Upon submit, the requested animals appear below the Why Adopt section. Users can click on the animals to open a new tab where they can learn more about their possible companion.

Below that, the Amazon API displays the most popular and highest rated pet toys.

Enjoy, and happy Fetching!

API: Petfinder, Amazon Web Services API
Tech: Balsamiq for wireframes, Bootstrap for styling, SVGs for Icons
Challenges: Timing, Petfinder API age, Amazon Web Services size of code, styling of the div for results to appear due to Petfinder API incongruency
Next Time: More breeds, More animals, Zip Code limiting/expanding, Search for shelters rather than pets
